# Can I study my cards in a particular order?

Spaced Repetition System is effective because it allows the user to focus 
on difficult material and not losing time with material you already know. 
Studying your cards in the same order over and over again is definitely
[not the best way to optimize your study time](./anki-is-not-showing-me-all-my-cards.md).

Anki allows for some control over the order of your cards when first showing them, 
but from that point the program, based on your answers, 
will decide when is best for you to review these cards again. The original order 
of the cards cannot be kept, because that would simply not make sense from the SRS point of view.

However, if you still want to use Anki as a traditional flashcard program 
and review all your cards in a particular order, you can sort your cards 
according to the criteria that best suits your needs in the [Browser](https://docs.ankiweb.net/browsing.html)
and use the Preview button. 

Please, note that previewing your cards from the Browser won't have any effect 
on your cards' history and no rescheduling is possible this way.
