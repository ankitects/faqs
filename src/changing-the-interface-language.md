# Changing the interface language

By default, Anki displays interface text such as menus and dialog boxes in the language you selected when you ran Anki for the first time. If you selected wrong or want to use multiple languages, you can change the language in Anki's preferences screen (ctrl+p on Windows/Linux, cmd+, on OS X). After selecting a new language, restart Anki for the new language to take effect.

If you've just started using Anki, after restarting, use File>Switch Profile to create a new profile that will use the language you've selected - otherwise things like field names will be in the previous language.
