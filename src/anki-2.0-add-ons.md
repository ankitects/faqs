# Anki 2.0 add-ons

**Due to the libraries Anki 2.0 uses no longer being supported, [Anki 2.0 has been discontinued](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/anki-2.0-support-has-ended.html), and may stop working in a future OS update. Please consider updating to Anki 2.1 instead.**

If the add-on you want has a 2.0 download link on AnkiWeb, you can download the add-on's .py or .zip file.

- If it's a .py file, place it in your add-on folder.
- If it's a .zip file, unzip the contents into your add-on folder.

Your add-on folder is inside your data folder: <https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations>

An archive of the old 2.0 add-ons has also been made available. To use it:

- Download the add-on archive from <https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/archive/addons-2.0.zip>
- Extract the zip.
- Search through the README file to locate the add-on ID you want.
- If it's a .py file, place it in your add-on folder.
- If it's a .zip file, unzip the contents into your add-on folder.

Your add-on folder is inside your data folder: <https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations>

**These add-ons are provided as-is, and no support can be provided for them.**
