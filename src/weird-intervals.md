# My learning cards do not follow my learning steps: Again, Hard and Good show weird intervals.

If youâ€™ve changed the learning steps recently, the cards may either need to exit 
learning or be marked Again to fix the steps. 

This issue was fixed in Anki 2.1.55, so if you're using an older version, updating is recommended.
