# Errors when recording

If you have problems recording audio in Anki, please make sure:

- a microphone is connected to the computer 
- the microphone is set as the default recording device in your system's sound settings
- another program like Skype is not using the microphone - you may need to close the other microphone-using program. If that does not help, please try restarting your computer.

If you receive the message `IOError: [Errno Unanticipated host error] -9999` on Windows 10, please make sure you have allowed Anki to use the microphone:
