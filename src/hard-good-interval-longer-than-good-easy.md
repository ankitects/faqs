# Hard/good interval is longer than good/easy

When a card is in learning:

- Again will be the first learning step
- Hard will repeat the current learning step (except on the first step, where it is the average of first and second steps)```
- Good will the the next learning step, or the Graduating interval if learning steps are exhausted
- Easy will be the Easy Interval

If the [learning steps](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html) are set to be longer than the [graduating or easy interval](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html), Hard/Good might show longer intervals than Good/Easy.
