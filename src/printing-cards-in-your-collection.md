# Printing cards in your collection

Some people like to print the cards in their collection so that they can review them on paper or for other reasons. Before you do this, please keep in mind that Anki is most effective when you study only through the application. Studying a list of your cards will necessarily require you to study them at suboptimal intervals compared to the ones Anki gives you.

Printing in Anki is handled by the [Basic Printing Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1025789669) add-on. If you have trouble getting your browser to open, please follow the directions in the review "WORKS, but does not open the browser automatically", located on that page.
