# When adding a new card, some fields do not reset!
Anki supports adjusting sticky fields directly from the editor window from v 2.1.45. This feature
can be turned on / off by clicking on the pin icon on the right of a field. 

If the pin icon is inactive, Anki will clear out the field's content after a note is added.
