# AnkiUniversal is not supported here

AnkiUniversal is by a separate group of developers and is not fully compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem - it does not support things like syncing of media, creating LaTeX images, and so on.

You may wish to consider using the official Anki version from <https://apps.ankiweb.net> instead.

If you wish to continue using AnkiUniversal, please direct any questions you have to the AnkiUniversal authors: ankiuniversal@gmail.com
