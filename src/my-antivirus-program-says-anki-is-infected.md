# My antivirus program says Anki is infected!

Antivirus programs sometimes get things wrong. This is especially so when we release a new version - some AV programs assume that because the new version has not been seen in the past that it must be dangerous. Anki updates are built on machines dedicated to that purpose, so the chances of a virus infection are very slim. If you've received a message from your antivirus, please contact your AV vendor to let them know about the false positive.
