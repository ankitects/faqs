# How can I donate / contribute?

As Anki is run as a business, it is difficult to accept donations. Instead, we
make available [AnkiMobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387)
to raise funds for development. You can purchase
AnkiMobile on your Apple mobile device, and the proceeds from it go towards
supporting Anki's development. If you use the Android app, you can also donate to [AnkiDroid](https://opencollective.com/ankidroid),
which is developed by a different team.

From time to time, people request other ways to contribute, such as by making
donations via a site like Patreon, or via something like BitCoin. These would
take time to set up and maintain, as we need to ensure no laws are being broken,
and relevant taxes are being paid. At the moment we feel that the time is better
spent working on Anki instead.

If you're unable to purchase the app for yourself or a friend, there are still
other ways you can contribute. Answering questions over on the [user
forums](https://forums.ankiweb.net) is a big help, as every question the
developers don't need to answer means more time that can be spent working on
Anki. And if you don't feel comfortable answering questions, telling your
friends about Anki helps out too.
