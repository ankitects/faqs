# What spaced repetition algorithm does Anki use?

Anki’s algorithm is based on the SuperMemo 2 algorithm. For info on
SM-2, please see <http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm>

Anki’s algorithm differs from SM-2 in some respects. Notably:

- SM-2 defines an initial interval of 1 day then 6 days. With Anki,
  you have full control over the length of the initial learning steps.
  Anki understands that it can be necessary to see a new card a number
  of times before you’re able to memorize it, and those initial
  "failures" don’t mean you need to be punished by being shown the
  failed card many times over the course of a few days. Performance
  during the learning stage does not reflect performance in the
  retaining stage.

- Anki uses 4 choices for answering review cards, not 6. There is only
  one _fail_ choice, not 3. The reason for this is that failure
  comprises a small amount of total reviews, and thus adjusting a
  card’s ease can be sufficiently done by simply varying the positive
  answers.

- Answering cards later than scheduled will be factored into the next
  interval calculation, so you receive a boost to cards that you were
  late in answering but still remembered.

- Like SM-2, Anki’s failure button resets the card interval by
  default. But the user can choose to have the card’s interval reduced
  instead of being reset completely. Also, you can elect to review
  failed mature cards on a different day, instead of the same day.

- _Remembered easily_ not only increments the ease factor, but adds an
  extra bonus to the current interval calculation. Thus, answering
  _remembered easily_ is a little more aggressive than the standard
  SM-2 algorithm.

- Successive failures while cards are in learning do not result in
  further decreases to the card’s ease. A common complaint with the
  standard SM-2 algorithm is that repeated failings of a card cause
  the card to get stuck in "low interval hell". In Anki, the initial
  acquisition process does not influence a card’s ease.

You can also check out `sched.py` and `schedv2.py` in Anki’s source code for the
scheduling code. Here is a summary (see the [deck options](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html)
section of the manual for the options that are mentioned in _italics_).

## Learning/Relearning Cards

If you press…​

- Again  
  Moves the card back to the first step setted in [Learning/Relearning Steps.](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?#learning-steps)

- Hard  
  Repeats the current step after the first step, and is the average of
  Again and Good.

- Good  
  Moves the card to the [next step](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?#learning-steps).
  If the card was on the final step, the card is converted into a
  review card (it 'graduates').

- Easy
  Immediately converts the card into a review card.

New cards have no ease, so no matter how many times you press
'Again' or 'Hard', the future ease factor of the card won't be affected.
The same can be said about relearning cards: pressing 'Again'
or 'Hard' won't have any effect over the card's ease.

## Review Cards

Once a card is graduated, it gets an ease factor. By default is 2.5, but you
can set another value using the [Deck Options](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html?#starting-ease).

If you press…​

- Again  
  The card is placed into relearning mode, the ease is decreased by 20
  percentage points (that is, 20 is subtracted from the _ease_ value,
  which is in units of percentage points), and the current interval is
  multiplied by the value of _new interval_ (this interval will be used
  when the card exits relearning mode).

- Hard  
  The card’s ease is decreased by 15 percentage points and the current
  interval is multiplied by the value of _hard interval_ (1.2 by default)

- Good  
  The current interval is multiplied by the current ease. The ease is
  unchanged.

- Easy  
  The current interval is multiplied by the current ease times the _easy
  bonus_ and the ease is increased by 15 percentage points.

For Hard, Good, and Easy, the next interval is additionally multiplied
by the _interval modifier_. If the card is being reviewed late,
additional days will be added to the current interval, as described
in a [previous FAQ.](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/due-times-after-a-break.html)

## Limitations

There are a few limitations on the scheduling values that cards can
take. Eases will never be decreased below 130%; SuperMemo’s research has
shown that eases below 130% tend to result in cards becoming due more
often than is useful and annoying users. Intervals will never be
increased beyond the value of _maximum interval_. Finally, all new
intervals (except Again) will always be at least one day longer than the
previous interval.

## Why doesn’t Anki use SuperMemo’s latest algorithm?

The simple answer is that SuperMemo’s latest algorithm is proprietary,
and requires licensing. As Anki is an open source application, it can
only make use of algorithms that have been made freely available.

We’re inclined to believe SuperMemo when they say their newer algorithms
are more efficient, but feel that to a certain extent, it is a case of
diminishing returns. The gains achieved by moving from a traditional
study routine to SM-2 are already great, and by sticking with an open
algorithm, your learning data is not locked into a single product.

Ultimately it’s up to you to decide - if access to the latest and
greatest scheduler is a higher priority than the things that Anki brings
to the table, you may want to check out SuperMemo to see if it is a good
fit for you.

## What about SM-5?

Anki’s scheduler was originally based on SuperMemo's SM-5. Anki’s default of
showing the next interval above each ease button revealed problems with the
implementation - harder cards could end up with greater interval increases than
easy ones, and the ease factors sometimes grew to the point where a single
review could result in a 20-30x increase in interval.

An attempt was made at the time to correct this by smoothing the optimal
factors matrix - applying a cap on the maximum factor and enforcing a
minimum difference between adjacent ease factors. This addressed the
above problems, but resulted in an optimal factors matrix that had very
little room to move, and the conclusion drawn at the time was that SM-5
was not an improvement over SM-2.

While SM-5 clearly wasn’t working for Anki, in hindsight, it may not
have been fair to assume the issues we encountered were due to
fundamental problems with the algorithm. SuperMemo have subsequently
stated that the description of the SM-5 algorithm listed on their
website is incomplete, so it is possible the problems we encountered do
not exist in SuperMemo’s proprietary implementation.
